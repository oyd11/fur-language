## Orthography:
Basing our keyboard maps on the orthography suggested in the SIL publication Kutsch Lojenga and Waag 2004: "The sounds and tones of Fur" 
[https://www.sil.org/resources/publications/entry/35935] - this seems to be the accepted orthography is publications in these years at least (2004-2017)
## Layouts:
(todo - unicode way to render keyboard layouts?)
### Gray-Alt layout:
..
ʉ ɨ a̱ ŋ 
tone-marks: áâǎ 
### 'xcv' overriding layout (xcvqf) :
QWERTY layout - overriding unused letters in Fur (xcvqf), to Fur letters (a̱ ɨ ʉ ŋ ny).

Fur letters in green, tone marks in pink. Gray-alt + key - provides the original US-qwerty key below it.
